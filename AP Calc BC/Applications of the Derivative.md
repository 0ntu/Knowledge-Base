# Interpreting a Derivative

Geometric - slope of the tangent line
The derivative of $f$ at $c$, if it exists, equals the limit of the average rate of change as of $f$ as $x$ approaches $c$

Physical - Velocity of the object
Analytical - Instantenous Rate of Change

# Differentials, Linear Approximations, Newton's Method

Differential of $x$, denoted as $dx$
$$dx=\Delta x\not=0$$
Differential of $y$, denoted as $dy$
$$dy=f'(x)dx$$

The differential $dy$ measures the height distance from a point, to a nearby point
For $\Delta x=dx$ closes to 0, $dy=f'(x)dx$ will be close to $\Delta y$
	- $\Delta y$ is the change in the height of the graph of $f$ from $x$ to $x+\Delta x$
	- $dy$ is the change in the height of the **tangent line** to the graph of $f$ from $x$ to $x+\Delta x$

The closer the $\Delta x$ is to 0, the closer $dy$ is to $\Delta y$
Tangent line departs less from the actual graph

Can be used as a *linear approximation* when near point of tangency

**Local linearity** - tangent line to the graph of a function can be used to approximate the function near the point of tangency
