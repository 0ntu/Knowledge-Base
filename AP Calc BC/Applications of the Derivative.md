# Interpreting a Derivative

Geometric - slope of the tangent line
The derivative of $f$ at $c$, if it exists, equals the limit of the average rate of change as of $f$ as $x$ approaches $c$

Physical - Velocity of the object
Analytical - Instantenous Rate of Change

# Differentials, Linear Approximations, Newton's Method
