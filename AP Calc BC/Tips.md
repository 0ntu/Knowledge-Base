# Chapters 1-3

Multiplying by a **NON-CONSTANT** requires the **PRODUCT RULE**
- Remember Constant Multiple Rule
$$y=x\sqrt{1-x}$$

Complex *exponents* can be **chain-ruled**
$$e^{2x}$$

sqrt of whole fraction = scrt of its components

Always use parenthesis / dot to indicate multiplication to avoid confusing negatives

Implicit Differntiation Simplification
- Separate
- Put together
- Factor out $y`$

To simplify ugly expressions from prod. rule
- Brackets around num. > KCF denominator
- Recognize common patterns to cancel out (turn $\frac{1}{2}$ exp. into
sqrts
- Multiplying a sqrt by itself turns it normal
$$\frac{\sqrt{2ax-x^{2}}}{x}$$
