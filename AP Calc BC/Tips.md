# Chapters 1-3

Multiplying by a **NON-CONSTANT** requires the **PRODUCT RULE**
$$y=x\sqrt{1-x}$$

To simplify ugly expressions from prod. rule
- Brackets around num. > KCF denominator
- Recognize common patterns to cancel out (turn $\frac{1}{2}$ exp. into
sqrts
- Multiplying a sqrt by itself turns it normal
$$\frac{\sqrt{2ax-x^{2}}}{x}$$
