# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

OOP makes programs more closely model the way people think about and deal with the world

We must provide *definitions* for objects, called **classes**
- Describes how object behaves, what info it contains, and how to create

## Methods
Method: A task or function given to an object

## Compiling and Running
Editor - Writes the text of a program

Text of a program in a particular programing language is referred to as *source code*

Compiling is the *process of converting a program* written in a high-level language to bytecode.

Errors detected by the compiler are called **compilation errors**
- Violation of syntax rules

Errors detected during runtime is caught by the interpreter
- Fault of logic in the program

Java interpreter processes *bytecode* and *executes instructions*
